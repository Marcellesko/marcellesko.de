                        Some features seen on the Krenia Server aren't contained in vanilla Minecraft (the base game). Most of the small changes are achieved
                        with so called datapacks, that use vanilla Minecraft commands to create new functionalities like changed or added crafting recipes, enhanced
                        trades or adapted mob and block behavior.
                        <br>The first list shows all the installed datapacks, what they do, how to use them and also links to the original download sites.
                        <br><br>
                        Some other functions on the server like the ingame voice chat aren't possible just with datapacks, but with mods. Those Mods can change a
                        whole lot more of the game and add completely new functions.
                        <br>The second list shows all the mods that are installed on the server.

                                    the game mechanics, that players would notice.

                                    save resources when a lot of people are online and still make the game look enjoyable when only a few are playing.
