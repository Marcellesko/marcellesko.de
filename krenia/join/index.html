                        Requirements:
                    </h1>
                    <span>
                        Until now the requirements to become a part of the <a href="/krenia/" class="info-paragraph-link"><b>Krenia SMP</b></a> have been quite loose,
                        but as of era 3 the rules for joining will be more strict.<br>
                        <br>
                        To join Krenia in the following eras you need to:<br>
                        - be at least around 16 Years old.<br>
                        - already be active on YouTube with propper content.<br>
                        - produce frequent SMP videos on YouTube.<br>
                        - be sure that you will not quit half way through the era.<br>
                        - make an application video.<br>
                        (<i>Exeptions are possible. Some examples of which are provable matureness, an impressive "resume" of finished projects or if you were
                        contaced/asked by Marcellesko directly.</i>)
                    </span>
                    <br><br>
                    <h1 class="info-paragraph-title">
                        Recruiting time frame:
                    </h1>
                    <span>
                        As the player list is fixed once an era begins and the duration of an era isn't clear from the beginning, the only time new members get
                        recruited is once the end of the previous era is in sight. If you found the project in the middle of an era and want to join, you will have
                        to wait until in between the eras.
                    </span>
                    <br><br>
                    <h1 class="info-paragraph-title">
                        Application:
                    </h1>
                    <span>
                        At the moment, the idea of a required application video is very new and not yet fully determined. However, if this method of approving new
                        members gets implemented, the following will be necessary in the application video:<br>
                        <br>
                        - Topics that you might implement in your videos (building, redstone, minigames, etc.)<br>
                        - Past or present experience with Minecraft and said topics.<br>
                        - Ruffly for how long you have been playing Minecraft.<br>
                        - The video can be anywhere from 2 to 25 minutes long.<br>
                        - If you want to prove your motivation to join, be creative and show someof your projects.<br>
                        - Your Name and how you want to be called.<br>
                        - Your Age (<i>only needed in the description or message</i>).<br>
                        - Anything I or the players should be aware of (<i>only needed in the description or message</i>).
                    </span>
                    <br><br>

                    <span>
                        If you can assure that all the above can be done and provided and you're interested to join the Krenia SMP, follow these steps:<br><br>
                        1. If not already existent, create a Discord account.<br>
                        2. Join the Krenia SMP Community <a href="https://www.discord.gg/yV4ysTm" target="_blank" class="info-paragraph-link"
                        aria-label="Takes you to the Discord Server">Discord Server</a>. (<i>Learn more <a href="/discord/" class="info-paragraph-link">
                        here</a>.</i>)<br>
                        3. Create the application video and upload it to YouTube either as public or unlisted.<br>
                        4. Send a Direkt Message to Marcellesko#1370 and provide the link to your video.
                        <br><br>
                        I will then answer as fast as I can. ( Please keep in mind that it might take some time, but probably not more than a few days.) Once I've
                        answered your message I will have a look at the application video and if you are suited to play on Krenia. If so, I will share the video
                        with other members that have been part of the project for a long time and discuss, whether to accept your application or not. (This might
                        also take multiple days if we are busy.)<br>
                        <br>
                        If you aren't sure if you want to join or don't plan to at all, and still have any questions, you can get answers basically the same way.
