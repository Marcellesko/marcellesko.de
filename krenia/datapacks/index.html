                        game). Most of the small changes are achieved with so called datapacks, that use vanilla Minecraft commands to create new functionalities
                        like changed or added crafting recipes, enhanced trades or adapted mob and block behavior.<br>
                        The first list shows all the installed datapacks, what they do, how to use them and also links to the original download sites.

                        Some other functions on the server like the ingame voice chat aren't possible just with datapacks, but with mods. Those Mods can change a
                        whole lot more of the game and add completely new functions.
                        <br>The second list shows all the mods that are installed on the server.
