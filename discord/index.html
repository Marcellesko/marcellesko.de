                        On my Discord Server I have created a nice and peaceful place to find new friends and teammates
                        in nearly every game you want. You can receive <b>information</b> about current and future
                        projects and events of mine and you might even get the chance of <b>entering</b> and taking
                        <b>part</b> in one yourself.

                    <span>
                        You can also get different <b>roles</b> depending on if you are creating content youself. You can come in one of the many <b>voice chats</b>
                        and talk to me and the others directly. If you need a place to gather with your friends and play some games, there are more than enough <b>
                        gaming voice chats</b>.

                        Discord is also one of the best places to contact me, if you have any <b>questions</b>
                        about me, my projects or anything else I might be helpful with. I'm almost always
                        reachable on there.
                        <br>
                        If you don't want to join the Discord Server (Although it is highly recommended!) you can also send me a direct message on discord: Marcellesko#1370
