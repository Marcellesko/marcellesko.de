                        On my Discord Server I have created a nice and peaceful place to find new friends and teammates
                        in nearly every game you want. You can recieve <b>information</b> about current and future
                        projects and events of mine and you might even get the chance of <b>entering</b> and taking
                        <b>part</b> in one yourself.
                    </span>
                    <br><br>
                    <span>
                        There are some <b>downloads</b> on there which might not be available here! For example the
                        <b>Minecraft Resource Pack</b> that I am usually using. You can also get different <b>roles</b>
                        depending on if you're following me on twitch, are a streamer of your own or if you took part in
                        an event. You can come in one of the many <b>voice chats</b> and talk to me and the others
                        directly. Plus: There are a couple of bots like a music player that can make the stay even more
                        pleasant.

                    <span>
                        Discord is also one of the best places to contact me, if you have any <b>questions</b>
                        about me, my projects or anything else you think I might be helpful with... I'm almost always
                        reachable on Discord... Talk to you soon over there :P
